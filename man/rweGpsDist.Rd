\title{Get number of subjects and the distances of PS distributions for each PS
strata for multiple data sources}
\usage{
rweGpsDist(data.gps, n.bins = 10, min.n0 = 10, type = c("ovl", "kl"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{min.n0}{threshold for N0, below which the external data in the
current stratum will be ignored by setting the PS distance to 0}

\item{d1.arm}{calculate distance based on a specific arm. Ignored if NULL.}
